I lost a house, my marriage, my retirement and I gained a lot of weight.
Turned it around, got my life back and became an inspiration to others.\n\n
I am probably a lot like you. I am a single mom, I work full time and i am
over 40(43 now!). I have had back issues and all of my workouts are designed
to prevent back pain and lesson symptoms.\n\nI gained over 50 lbs while pregnant.
I now have abs all the time and believe ANYONE can have abs, without crazy
starvation diets or endless crunches.\n\nNo matter WHAT your situation is, no
matter WHERE you are starting from and no matter WHAT you are facing, there is
always hope and possibility.\n\nI know you can be next. I WANT you to be next.
I did all of the thinking and testing on myself, friends and then tens of thousands
of people later, I’ve made it SIMPLE for you.\n\nWith that in mind, I’ve created
this app which is packed with fun and super effective workouts. For a small monthly
fee, you will have access to content people pay an arm and leg for — new workouts and
exercise videos are added weekly! Join me and let\’s turn your life around! :)
